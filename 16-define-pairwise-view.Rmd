# Visualize a pairwise
In this section you will create a multi-group pairwise visual.

* Click on the `PCA` data step and select `Add` 

* Choose a `Data step`

This will create a second data step branch, opening a new projection.

* Clear the projection so that it will be completely emtpy

We will now create a pairwise projection of the ``variable`` factor.

* Drag-n-drop the ``measurement`` factor to the _y-axis zone_
* Drag-n-drop the ``variable`` factor to the _column zone_
* Drag-n-drop the ``variable`` factor to the _row zone_
* Drag-n-drop the ``index`` factor to the _label zone_

Resize the projection by dragging the row lines tighter, similarly for the columns. Once resized the projection should look like the image below.

This is **a pairwise projection** and it is a direct result of putting the same factor (i.e. ``variable``) on the row and column zone. However this projection can be further developed into a **multi-group pairwise**.

* Drag-n-drop the ``sp`` factor to the _column zone_
* Drag-n-drop the ``sex`` factor to the _color zone_

You have now visualized a multi-group pairwise projection. This view is a powerful tool for data visualization.

* Go back to the workflow page by clicking on "My new workflow"

Your workflow should look like the image below

Note the new data step box you added got pasted on top of the previous data step called "Results". 

* Drag the step called `Data step` to the right

* Right click on the new step called `Data step` and select `Rename`

* Rename it to "Pairwise"

It should now look like:

* Save the workflow

You visualized the data using a multi-group pairwise projection. In the next section we will share your new results with your team.
