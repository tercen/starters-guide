# View the Crabs workflow


In this section we walk you through the crabs project you just cloned in the prevous section.

You start off in your personal page, and you navigate to project.


* Click on `Teams`

* Click on `Tutorial team`

\ 

* Click on `Tutorial project`

You are now on the crabs project page and it looks like:

<center><img src="images/view_crabs_project_page.png"></center>
\

it contains the folllowing:

* Project tab
    * Data
    * Workflow
* Discussion tab
* Activity tab

* Click on `Tutorial workflow`
<center><img src="images/click_on_crabs_workflow.png"></center>
\

The workflow is opened and can interact on your data. It will look like the image below:

The "crabs_longformat" is preloaded data, containing information about crabs. 
We performed a __PCA__ on the data using one of our __Operators__. We call this a __data step__.

* Doubleclick on `PCA`

\
You can see that we visualised the data from the crabs_longformat table using heatmap.
The __ PCA operator__ is shown on the left.
The data produced by this __data step__ can be visualized by adding another __data step__.

* Go back to the workflow main page by clicking on `Tutorial workflow`

\

* Click on `PCA results`



On the left side of the __projection__ you can see the results of the __PCA__ are available for visualization.

\
We visualized the data using PC1 and PC2, while coloring the species and sex of the crabs.\
Thanks to the drag and drop way of working in __tercen__ you can quickly and intuitively visualize the results of your data. 

Your data can be visualized in many ways using __tercen__ and every visualization can provide different insights. Next we will visualize the crabs_longformat using a pair-wise plot. 

* Click on `Tutorial workflow` to go back to the workflow page
* Click on `Pair-wise plot`

You will see the __projection__ of the __data step__, as seen in the image below.

<center><img src="images/view_pairwise.png"></center>
\
In this __projection__ you can see that we visualized the differences between male and female, by coloring by sex.
In the columns you can appreciate that you can add multiple levels, differentiating between the species and the variables.

You now have an idea of the possibilities using __tercen__. For more information about how to upload and work with your own data, continue reading the getting started guide.
