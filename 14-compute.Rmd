# Compute your data
In this section we perform a computation by selecting a previously installed operator and running it on the data.


The projection you created in the previous section can also be used by a computation (i.e. __operator__).
This is due to the _What you see is what you compute_ paradigm. 

First we will select the operator of choice.

Continue in the projection we created in the previous chapter.

* Click on the save icon beside the `My new workflow` to save the workflow

* Go to the My new workflow page by clicking on it

The data step is now presented:

The operators in every step can also be activated from the workflow page by right clicking on the data step and selecting `Run`
The the data step status is indicated by the color on the top right corner, red means not activated and green means activated.

* Right click on the data step and select `Rename`

* Always name the steps descriptive to keep a clear workflow. 
* Rename to "PCA"

The steps in the workflow can be dragged to your liking. Try to keep your workflow easily interpretable.

* Drag the "PCA" step around

* Save the entire workflow by clicking on the save icon

We have computed a PCA on the data. In the upcoming sections we take a look at the results of the PCA.
