# Next steps

The Starter's Guide has been designed to give an overview of __Tercen__ and teach you how to navigate the interface.

\

It is not intended to provide detailed knowledge of complex, technical areas such as creating workflows. Further training is required for this.

\

We highly recommend that you try our [__Crabs Tutorial__](https://tercen.github.io/crabs_tutorial/) to gain more in-depth knowledge of workflows using a real data set. 

\

We are also on hand to provide a one-to-one training session for further guidance.

\

Our instructors will show you how to build workflows optimised to suit your scientific specialty.

\

You can book a session here.

\

After that, the __Tercen__ user manual provides more detail on the functions of the software and how to create apps for data manipulation.
