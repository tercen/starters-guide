# Understanding projects

Projects are another key concept in __Tercen__.

They are the "containers" where your research and calculations are held. 

Projects can be set as private or public.

* __Private__ projects can only be viewed by the person or team that owns it. They can be copied and adjusted only by these people.

* __Public__ projects can be viewed and collaborated-on by the wider community. They can be copied by anyone and used as a basis for new research.

\

Projects have the following characteristics.

* A project is created by a Team.
* Data is uploaded to projects.
* Workflows are attached to projects - to analyse and create visualisations of data.
* Projects hold the record of comments and feedback submitted by your team or community.
* Supporting documents can be uploaded to projects.

\

Tercen provides two ways to create a project. 

* __Create New__ - A blank project which you will add data and workflows to.
* __Clone__ - A copy of an existing project, which you then modify.

\

## Clone an existing project {-}

\

The simplest method to create a project is to __Clone__ it from a pre-existing one. 

Any project can be cloned once you have access to it.

Personal projects, projects created by your team, and publicly shared projects can all be cloned. 

\

To access the __Tercen__ public projects click the `Explore` link in the header bar. 

You will be taken to the public projects page.

\

It is divided into two sections.

* `Collections` is where __Tercen__ displays sponsored research examples

* `Community` is where all of the projects made __Public__ by their creators appear.
