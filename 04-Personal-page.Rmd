In __Tercen__ you are always working in a team. 
Even if it is a team of just one person, like your personal page.

Teams have members and  projects. Projects have data, work-flows, and documentation. 

__Tercen__ assigns an icon to a team when it is created. You were assigned the large icon for your personal account. Icons exist to to help you identify which team you are working for at any time.

The smaller icons at the bottom of the section show the teams you are member of.
