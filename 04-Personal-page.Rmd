## Team icons {-}

In __Tercen__ you are always working in a team. Even if it is a team of just one person like your personal page.

Teams have members and  projects. Projects have data, work-flows, and documentation. 

__Tercen__ assigns an icon to a team when it is created. You were assigned this large icon for your personal account. The icons are there to help you identify which team you are working for at any time.

The small icons show the teams you are member of.

Click the small icons at the bottom of the section go to the Team Page and see all of the projects that team is working on.
