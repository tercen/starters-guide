# Define a team

Teams are an important concept in __Tercen__. Researchers are members of a team and as part of the team they create and own projects. 

\

Teams have the following characteristics. 

* A team is created by a user.
* The creator is the Administrator of the team.
* Teams are composed of members.
* Users can be members of many teams.
* Teams own a Library of Apps and a set Projects they are applied to
* Members have access permissions to control how they affect the things the team owns.

\

In __Tercen__ you always work in a team. Even if it is just a single member of your personal team.

\

To create a team select the __Teams__ tab on your personal home page.
