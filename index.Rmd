# Introduction

<center>__empower__ the scientist... __liberate__ the programmer.</center>

\

Ever-modernising technology has caused an explosion of data available to scientists in all fields. So much so, that projects frequently become bogged down by the sheer volume of raw data and the shortage of specialist skills needed to analyse it.  

\

Not everyone can code, or even wants to, but everyone wants to benefit from the wealth of information generated by this revolution.

\

__Tercen__  is a cloud based analytics platform. It provides simple visual tools that allow a non-programmer to build powerful data-analysis models with sophisticated visualisations.

Using __Tercen__, scientists (such as biologists) can explore their data sets unaided. The platform helps them to take back control of their data and empowers them to drive forward with their research rather than wait for scarce programming resources.  

__Tercen__ also benefits programmers (such as Bioinformaticians) who can off-load their day-to-day administration of data analysis tasks. 

By uploading code and web-apps to __Tercen__ the programmer can standardise work-flows for the biologist to use. This ensures the teams' data-analysis process is under control at all times and allows the programmer to focus on more interesting projects.

\

Lastly, __Tercen__ is committed to promoting open science. Our software is a platform for the scientific community to collaborate on data analysis.

Projects can be made public for feedback and to get assistance. Public information can be cloned and expanded on by other researchers. 

Code and apps for data-analysis can be applied to projects beyond what they were originally written for, thus benefiting the scientific community and the world large.
