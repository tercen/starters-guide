# Introduction

<center><img src="images/cover.png"></center>

\

There has been an explosion of data in Business and Life Sciences. Not everyone can code, or even wants to, but everyone wants to benefit from the wealth of information generated by this revolution.

\

__Tercen__  is the cloud based analytics platform that makes this happen. 

\

We provide simple visual tools that allow a non-programmer to build powerful data-analysis models and sophisticated visualisations.

\

Biologists can explore their data sets unaided. You can drag and drop complex computations together. No need to wait for a Bioinformatician.

\

This benefits the bioinformatician too. Computations are standardised with apps and workflows. Day-to-day admin is off-loaded while you focus on more interesting projects.

\

__Tercen__ promotes open science. It's a platform for scientists to collaborate. Share your findings, get feedback. Your project could be cloned to benefit areas far beyond your original scope.    

\

This is how __Tercen__ helps you to take back control of your data. It empowers you to drive forward with your research.  Biologists are empowered. Bioinformaticians... liberated.
