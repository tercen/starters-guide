# Working with projects

This section will orientate you to the __Tercen__ project screens. 

\

You will learn the meanings of the icons.

\

You will be shown how to upload data and view a workflow.

\

## Navigating and commenting {-}

Icons perform administrative tasks and to provide visual information about the status of your project.

<center><img src="images/08_work_with_projects_project_icons_1.png"></center>

\

`Clone`   - This icon allows you to copy the project.\
`Locked`  - Shows that project has not been made public. Only the team can view it.\

\

Hovering your mouse over a project element will cause administration icons to appear.

\

`Rename`  - Change the name of the element.\
`Export`  - Export this element. It can then be added to other projects.\
`Clone`   - Projects can have more than one workflow.\   
`Delete`  - Removes the selected element.\

\

A project has three main tabs for organisation.

<center><img src="images/08_work_with_projects_project_tabs.png"></center>

\

`Project`       - where the main elements of the research are accessed.\
`Discussions`   - Where team members and public users can discuss and comment.\
`Activities`    - A log of the comments and operations performed on the project.\

\

Selecting the __Activities__ tab will show a history of the project.

\

Any comments or changes are logged here.

They are listed in a descending time-line.

Clicking on a link will bring you to the relevant event.

\

Selecting the __Discussions__ tab will show the forums where feedback is shared.

<center><img src="images/08_work_with_projects_discussions_add.png"></center>

\

Discussion threads can be created and comments added by anyone with permission to view the project.

\

<center><img src="images/08_work_with_projects_discussions_thread.png"></center>

\

Users with project __admin__ permissions can edit or delete all comments.

\

The __Project__ tab contains three sections containing elements of the research project.

\


__Functions Bar__

<center><img src="images/08_work_with_projects_project_project_tab_functions.png"></center>

\

The main commands which can be performed on a project.

\

__Latest Activity__ 

<center><img src="images/08_work_with_projects_project_project_tab_activity.png"></center>

\

The last action on the project as logged in `Activities`.

\

__Elements List__ 

<center><img src="images/08_work_with_projects_project_project_tab_elements.png"></center>

\

These are the files that are attached to the project. They can be documents, data, or workflows.

\

## Upload data {-}

<center><img src="images/08_work_with_projects_new_data_set.png"></center>

Click `New data set` to add a data file

\

<center><img src="images/08_work_with_projects_new_data_set_choose.png"></center>

\

Give your data a name.

Browse to the location of the data file and select it

__Tercen__ will attempt to detect the type of data file you have added.

\

<center><img src="images/08_work_with_projects_new_data_set_type.png"></center>

\

You can over-ride the settings by selecting the following

* Seperator character
* Style used for quotes
* Encoding Type

Latin 1 is the simplest encoding type but does not recognise all possible diacritical marks. 

If you have data in a language with many accent marks encode your data as UTF-8 before uploading.

\

__Tercen__ will attempt to recognise your data and will show you error messages to help debug it.

When your data is recognised __Tercen__ will display a representation of it.

Click the ``Next` button

\

>(I don't know what this is)

\

Click `Ok` to complete the upload of your data

\

## Import and view workflows {-}

Workflows can be imported as a .zip file created by exporting from another project.

\

<center><img src="images/08_work_with_projects_project_project_workflow_import.png"></center>

\

<center><img src="images/08_work_with_projects_project_project_workflow_import_detail.png"></center>

\

Workflows can be created new.

\

<center><img src="images/08_work_with_projects_project_project_workflow_new.png"></center>

\

Worflows can be viewed and edited by clicking on its element link.

\

<center><img src="images/08_work_with_projects_project_project_workflow_select.png"></center>

When creating or viewing a workflow you will see the Workflow page

\

For more information on creating and modifying workflows see the next chapter.

\

## Adding Documentation {-}

Documents can be added to a project by writing a text file directly in __Tercen__

\

<center><img src="images/08_work_with_projects_project_document_new.png"></center>

\

Or uploading a file created in a different program.
