# Visualize the result
In this section you visualize the output of your PCA computation. The visualization uses two principal components in a pair-wise plot.

* Right click on the data step "PCA" and select `Add` 

* Select `Data step`

A new projection page opens. 
Looking at the factors on the left of your screen, you will notice there are additional factors in the factor list compared to last section, namely `ds0.PC1`, `ds0.PC2`, etc..

First we require to empty the project by removing factors. Note a tiny x appears when the mouse is placed over the factor zone.

* Hover over the zones

* Click on the `x` to clear the zone, repeat for every zone

The result view should be an empty projection.

Now you create the required projection:

* Drag-n-drop the ``ds0.PC2`` factor to the _x-axis zone_
* Drag-n-drop the ``ds0.PC3`` factor to the _y-axis zone_
* Drag-n-drop the ``sex`` and ``sp`` factors to the _colors zone_

* Click on `Crabs workflow` to return to the workflow

* Right click on the Data step and select `Rename`

* Rename it to "Results"

* Save workflow by clicking on the save icon beside the "Crabs workflow"  

Congratulations on your first PCA analysis visualization. 
Now you will use a multi-group pairwise projection on the Crabs data.
