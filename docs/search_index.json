["index.html", "Starter’s guide to Tercen Chapter 1 Introduction", " Starter’s guide to Tercen Tercen support document Chapter 1 Introduction This step-by-step guide outlines how to upload, view, compute and share data using Tercen. It uses a multivariate example data set of morphological measurements of two species of Leptograpsus Crabs collected at Fremantle, W. Australia (see Mahon 1974). Why read this guide? : It is the easiest and quickest path to understanding the basics of Tercen. Acknowledgement: I would like to thank all the users for their feedback. It has helped us improve Tercen. Feedback: If you wish to give feedback then please do not hesitate to create an entry in the issue tracker. Motivation: Tercen promotes collaboration for data analysis. Not everyone can code or even wants to, but everyone should benefit from the explosion of data and code currently taking place. Tercen allows non programmers (e.g. biologists) to explore their data and allows programmers (e.g. bioinformaticians) to upload their code (or web-apps) for the biologist to use. By offering these services we believe biologists get empowered and can claim back control of their data. The bioinformatician gets liberated from the operational details and day to day analysis demands from the biologist. This is summed up with the phrase: Tercen empowers the biologist and liberates the bioinformatician. "],

It will look like the image below: The “crabs_longformat” is preloaded data, containing information about crabs. We performed a PCA on the data using one of our Operators. We call this a data step. Doubleclick on PCA You see that we visualised the data from the crabs_longformat table using a heatmap. The __ PCA operator__ is shown on the left. The data produced by this data step is visualized by adding another data step. Go back to the workflow main page by clicking on Crabs workflow Click on PCA results On the left side of the projection you see the results of the PCA. We visualized the data using PC1 and PC2, while coloring the species and sex of the crabs. Thanks to the drag and drop way of working in tercen you can quickly and intuitively visualize the results of your data. Your data can be visualized in many ways using tercen and every visualization can provide different insights. Next you will visualize the crabs_longformat using a pair-wise plot. Click on Crabs workflow to go back to the workflow page Click on Pair-wise plot You will see the projection of the data step, as seen in the image below. In this projection you see that we visualized the differences between male and female, by coloring by sex. In the columns you can appreciate that you can add multiple levels, differentiating between the species and the variables. You now have an idea of the possibilities using Tercen.

Also we provide you with the example dataset’s download location, which you will use for this guide. The Example dataset: The data set for this guide is available online as a git hub repository.

Save your data on your desktop. Use the default name (it should be crabs_longformat.csv). Crab data description: The data set is called “Crabs” and it is in a long format. It has a total of 1000 measurements of crab physical traits. It is composed of four groups (two sexes and two species) of 50 measurements for five traits variables, FL (frontal lobe size in mm), RW (rear width mm), CL (carapace length mm), CW (carapace width mm) and BD (body depth mm). In summary it is: Factor values sp species, B or O for Blue or Orange. sex M or F index index 1 to 50 within each of the four groups, 2 sex and 2 species variable one of five variables: FL, RW, CL, CW and BD measurement the value of one of the five variable observation index 1 to 200 observations for each variable Navigate to your projects homepage.

The difference between a wide format and a long format: In a long format only one measurement is described in a single row, which makes the table very long, hence the name. In a wide format multiple measurements are described in a single row, for example genome data often contains the different samples in the columns. You have successfully uploaded data on to Tercen.

Resize the projection by dragging the row lines tighter, similarly for the columns. Once resized the projection should look like the image below. This is a pairwise projection and it is a direct result of putting the same factor (i.e. variable) on the row and column zone. However this projection can be further developed into a multi-group pairwise.
