Ever-modernising technology has caused an explosion of data available to scientists in all fields. So much so, that projects frequently become bogged down by the sheer volume of raw data and the shortage of specialist skills needed to analyse it. Not everyone can code, or even wants to, but everyone wants to benefit from the wealth of information generated by this revolution. Tercen is a cloud based analytics platform. It provides simple visual tools that allow a non-programmer to build powerful data-analysis models with sophisticated visualisations. Using Tercen, scientists (such as biologists) can explore their data sets unaided. The platform helps them to take back control of their data and empowers them to drive forward with their research rather than wait for scarce programming resources. Tercen also benefits programmers (such as Bioinformaticians) who can off-load their day-to-day administration of data analysis tasks. By uploading code and web-apps to Tercen the programmer can standardise work-flows for the biologist to use. This ensures the teams’ data-analysis process is under control at all times and allows the programmer to focus on more interesting projects. Lastly, Tercen is committed to promoting open science. Our software is a platform for the scientific community to collaborate on data analysis. Projects can be made public for feedback and to get assistance. Public information can be cloned and expanded on by other researchers. Code and apps for data-analysis can be applied to projects beyond what they were originally written for, thus benefiting the scientific community and the world large. Next… about this starters guide.

["define-a-team.html", "Chapter 6 Define a team", " Chapter 6 Define a team Teams are an important concept in Tercen. Researchers are members of a team and inside the team they create and own projects. Teams have the following characteristics. A team is created by a user. The creator is the Administrator of the team. Teams are composed of members. Users can be members of many teams. Teams own a Library of Apps and a set Projects they are applied to Members have access permissions to control how they affect the things the team owns. In Tercen you always work in a team. Even if it is just a single member of your personal team. To create a team. Access the Teams tab on your personal home page. Press the New Team button. Configure your team on the administration page. Name your team Enter the user-name of any person you want to add to the team. Select their access permissions. Read - Can view and clone projects Read Write - Can modify projects, such as adding operators to work-flows Admin - Can add and remove users to the team and change their permissions Click the Ok button to save your configuration. A Teams membership can be modified at later stage. To do this, access the Team Page by clicking on its icon.

["add-apps-to-a-library.html", "Chapter 7 Add apps to a library", " Chapter 7 Add apps to a library Each personal user, and each team, has a repository of apps called a Library. Apps are the workhorses of a Project and perform the calculations on the data you upload. There are different types of App template app defines an analysis pipeline to suit a type of research (e.g. RNAseq). workflow app a pre-defined set of computations and their visualisations (e.g. a two-group comparison) operator app performs a single computation on the data. (e.g. PCA function) Libraries can be built from differant sources such as the public Tercen app library or uploaded from private sources such as GitHub. For a more in-depth discussion of apps, and their uses, please see the User Guide. To install an app to your Library Access your personal home page Or move to a Team Page by clicking the icon Press the Add operator button Select the app you want to add. It will turn green.

["understanding-projects.html", "Chapter 8 Understanding projects 8.1 Explore public projects 8.2 Clone an existing project 8.3 Create a new project", " Chapter 8 Understanding projects Projects are another key concept in Tercen, they are the containers where your research is held. Projects can be set as private and restricted to you or your team. Or they can be made public, which enables collaboration with the wider community. A project is created by a Team. Data is uploaded to projects. Workflows are attached to projects - to analyse and create visualisations of data. Projects hold the record of comments and feedback submitted by your team or community. Supporting documents can be uploaded to projects. In previous sections you learned how to locate your personal projects, and the projects created by your teams. Tercen also provides a platform where Publicly shared projects can be accessed from the cloud. 8.1 Explore public projects To access the Tercen public projects click the Explore link in the header bar. You will be taken to the public projects page which is divided into two sections. Collections where Tercen displays sponsored research examples Community where all the projects made “Public” by their creators appear. 8.2 Clone an existing project Tercen provides two ways to create a project. Create New - A blank project you will add data and workflows to. Clone - A copy of an existing project, which you then modify. The simplest method for creating a project is to Clone from a pre-existing project. Any project can be cloned once you have access. Personal projects, projects created by your teams and public shared projects, can all be cloned. Find the project you wish to clone. For example, in the public community. Hover your mouse over the project until the Clone icon appears. Click it. Select whether to copy the project to your personal home page or one of your teams. Edit the name and description of your new project and decide if you want to make it publicly available or not. Click Ok This will copy any uploaded data, workflows, and supporting documents contained in the original project. Discussion forum posts and activity histories will not be copied, they are re-set to be blank. Your new project is now ready for modification. 8.3 Create a new project New Project Select A Team Enter Project Description Next… working with projects. "],

It will look like the image below: The “crabs_longformat” is preloaded data, containing information about crabs. We performed a PCA on the data using one of our Operators. We call this a data step. Doubleclick on PCA You see that we visualised the data from the crabs_longformat table using a heatmap. The __ PCA operator__ is shown on the left. The data produced by this data step is visualized by adding another data step. Go back to the workflow main page by clicking on Crabs workflow Click on PCA results On the left side of the projection you see the results of the PCA. We visualized the data using PC1 and PC2, while coloring the species and sex of the crabs. Thanks to the drag and drop way of working in Tercen you can quickly and intuitively visualize the results of your data. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD Your data can be visualized in many ways using Tercen and every visualization can provide different insights. Next we will visualize the crabs_longformat using a pair-wise plot. ======= Your data can be visualized in many ways using tercen and every visualization can provide different insights. Next you will visualize the crabs_longformat using a pair-wise plot. Click on Crabs workflow to go back to the workflow page 51f05425df5e488a0435ce0890df3d652a6b95ff Click on Pair-wise plot You will see the projection of the data step, as seen in the image below. In this projection you see that we visualized the differences between male and female, by coloring by sex. In the columns you can appreciate that you can add multiple levels, differentiating between the species and the variables. You now have an idea of the possibilities using Tercen.
