["index.html", "Starter’s guide to Tercen Chapter 1 Introduction", " Starter’s guide to Tercen Tercen support document Chapter 1 Introduction This step-by-step guide outlines how to upload, view, compute and share data using Tercen. It uses an example data set of morphological measurements on Leptograpsus Crabs collected at Fremantle, W. Australia. Why read this guide? : It is the easiest and quickest path to understanding the basics of Tercen. Acknowledgement: I would like to thank all the users for their feedback. It has helped us improve Tercen. Feedback: If you wish to give feedback then please do not hesitate to create an entry in the issue tracker. Motivation: Tercen promotes collaboration for data analysis. Not everyone can code or even wants to, but everyone should benefit from the explosion of data and code currently taking place. Tercen allows non programmers (e.g. biologists) to explore their data and allows programmers (e.g. bioinformaticians) to upload their code (or web-apps) for the biologist to use. By offering these services we believe biologists get empowered and can claim back control of their data. The bioinformatician gets liberated from the operational details and day to day analysis demands from the biologist. This is summed up with the phrase: Tercen empowers the biologist and liberates the bioinformatician. "],

Starting in the project homepage, you will see that the Tutorial workflow and crabs data is preloaded. Click on Tutorial workflow The workflow is shown. This is the environment where you can visualize and compute your data. It will look like the image below The “crabs_longformat” is preloaded data, containing information about crabs. We performed a PCA on the data using one of our Operators. We call this a data step. Doubleclick on PCA You can see that we visualised the data from the crabs_longformat table using heatmap. The __ PCA operator__ is shown on the left. The data produced by this data step can be visualized by adding another data step. Go back to the workflow main page by clicking on Tutorial workflow Click on PCA results On the left side of the projection you can see the results of the PCA are available for visualization. We visualized the data using PC1 and PC2, while coloring the species and sex of the crabs. Thanks to the drag and drop way of working in the Tercen cloud you can quickly and intuitively visualize the results of your data. Your data can be visualized in many ways using the Tercen cloud and every visualization can provide different insights. Next we will visualize the crabs_longformat using a pair-wise plot. Click on Tutorial workflow to go back to the workflow page Click on Pair-wise plot You will see the projection of the data step, as seen in the image below. In this projection you can see that we visualized the differences between male and female, by coloring by sex. In the columns you can appreciate that you can add multiple levels, differentiating between the species and the variables. You now have an idea of the possibilities using the Tercen cloud. For more information about how to upload and work with your own data, continue reading the getting started guide. "],

The Tercen cloud accepts data in either .tsv or csv. The example data set crabs_longformat.csv is in a .csv format and is in a long format. On the bottom of this section we will show the differences between a long format and a _wide format. Also we provide you with the example dataset’s download location, which we advice you to use for this guide. Navigate to your projects homepage. Click on New data set A dialog window opens which allows you to select the data file’s location. * Enter a name for the data you want to upload * Click on Choose File and select your file’s location (i.e. “C:\\data\\papercrabs_longformat.csv”). Leave the defaults. Click Next You will see which column headers were detected and the detected data type. Click Next The Tercen cloud will need your table to be in a long format. Now you will have the option to transform your uploaded data table from a wide format into a long format if needed. If needed: Select the columns which have measurements Click Ok You will now see the new data set in the projects homepage. The difference between a wide format and a long format: In a long format only one measurement is described in a single row, which makes the table very long, hence the name. In a wide format multiple measurements are described in a single row, for example genome data often contains the different samples in the columns. You have successfully uploaded data into the Tercen cloud. In the next section we create a workflow for the analysis of the data. The Example dataset: The data set for this guide is available online as a git hub repository. Go the file, by clicking on the following git hub address: (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tercen/starters-guide2/master/data/crabs_longformat.csv) Once it opens, right click and select Save as... Save your data on your desktop. Use the default name (it should be crabs_longformat.csv). Crab data description: The data set is called “crabs” and it is in a long format. It has a total of 1000 measurements of crab physical traits. It is composed of four groups (two sexes and two species) of 50 measurements for five traits variables, FL (frontal lobe size in mm), RW (rear width mm), CL (carapace length mm), CW (carapace width mm) and BD (body depth mm). In summary it is: Factor values sp species, B or O for Blue or Orange. sex M or F index index 1 to 50 within each of the four groups, 2 sex and 2 species variable one of five variables: FL, RW, CL, CW and BD measurement the value of one of the five variable observation index 1 to 200 observations for each variable "],
