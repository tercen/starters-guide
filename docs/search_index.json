Ever-modernising technology has caused an explosion of data available to scientists in all fields. So much so, that projects frequently become bogged down by the sheer volume of raw data and the shortage of specialist skills needed to analyse it. Not everyone can code, or even wants to, but everyone wants to benefit from the wealth of information generated by this revolution. Tercen is a cloud based analytics platform. It provides simple visual tools that allow a non-programmer to build powerful data-analysis models with sophisticated visualisations. Using Tercen, scientists (such as biologists) can explore their data sets unaided. The platform helps them to take back control of their data and empowers them to drive forward with their research rather than wait for scarce programming resources. Tercen also benefits programmers (such as Bioinformaticians) who can off-load their day-to-day administration of data analysis tasks. By uploading code and web-apps to Tercen the programmer can standardise work-flows for the biologist to use. This ensures the teams’ data-analysis process is under control at all times and allows the programmer to focus on more interesting projects. Lastly, Tercen is committed to promoting open science. Our software is a platform for the scientific community to collaborate on data analysis. Projects can be made public for feedback and to get assistance. Public information can be cloned and expanded on by other researchers. Code and apps for data-analysis can be applied to projects beyond what they were originally written for, thus benefiting the scientific community and the world large. Next… about this starters guide.

["define-a-team.html", "Chapter 6 Define a team", " Chapter 6 Define a team Teams are an important concept in Tercen. Researchers are members of a team and inside the team they create and own projects. Teams have the following characteristics. A team is created by a user. The creator is the Administrator of the team. Teams are composed of members. Users can be members of many teams. Teams own a Library of Apps and a set Projects they are applied to Members have access permissions to control how they affect the things the team owns. In Tercen you always work in a team. Even if it is just a single member of your personal team. To create a team. Access the Teams tab on your personal home page. Press the New Team button. Configure your team on the administration page. Name your team Enter the user-name of any person you want to add to the team. Select their access permissions.

["add-apps-to-a-library.html", "Chapter 7 Add apps to a library", " Chapter 7 Add apps to a library Each personal user, and each team, has a repository of apps called a Library. Apps are the workhorses of a Project and perform the calculations on the data you upload. There are different types of App template app defines an analysis pipeline to suit a type of research (e.g. RNAseq). workflow app a pre-defined set of computations and their visualisations (e.g. a two-group comparison) operator app performs a single computation on the data. (e.g. PCA function) Libraries can be built from differant sources such as the public Tercen app library or uploaded from private sources such as GitHub. For a more in-depth discussion of apps, and their uses, please see the User Guide.

["understanding-projects.html", "Chapter 8 Understanding projects Explore public projects Clone an existing project Create a new project", " Chapter 8 Understanding projects Projects are another key concept in Tercen, they are the containers where your research is held. Projects can be set as “Private” or “Public” Private projects can only be viewed by you personally or the team that owns it. Private projects can be copied and adjusted only by these people. Public projects are available to be viewed and collaborated-on by the wider community. They can be copied by anyone to use as a basis for their own research. A project is created by a Team. Data is uploaded to projects. Workflows are attached to projects - to analyse and create visualisations of data. Projects hold the record of comments and feedback submitted by your team or community. Supporting documents can be uploaded to projects. In previous sections you learned how to locate your personal and team projects. Tercen also provides a platform where Publicly shared projects can be accessed from the cloud. Explore public projects To access the Tercen public projects click the Explore link in the header bar. You will be taken to the public projects page which is divided into two sections. Collections is where Tercen displays sponsored research examples Community is where all of the projects made “Public” by their creators appear. Clone an existing project Tercen provides two ways to create a project. Create New - A blank project you will add data and workflows to. Clone - A copy of an existing project, which you then modify. The simplest method for creating a project is to Clone from a pre-existing project. Any project can be cloned once you have access. Personal projects, projects created by your teams, and public shared projects can all be cloned. Find the project you wish to clone. For example, in the public community. Hover your mouse over the project until the Clone icon appears. Click on the icon. Select the destination of the new project, your personal home page or, one of your teams. Click the Next Button Edit the name and description of your new project. Decide if you want to make it publicly available. Click the Ok Button This will copy any uploaded data, workflows, and supporting documents contained in the original project. Discussion forum posts and activity histories will not be copied. They are re-set to be blank. Your new project is now ready for modification. Create a new project You have the option to create a new project from the projects tab of your personal home page or from one of your team pages. In Click the New Project Button If you have created a project from your personal page you will be given the option to assign it to your personal page or one of your teams. Assign a destination and click the Next button to add a description If you create a project from a team page it will be automatically assigned to that team. You will be prompted to add a description.. You have created a new project Next… working with projects. "],

You will learn the meanings of the icons. You will be shown how to upload data and create a basic workflow. Navigating and commenting Icons exist to perform administrative tasks and to provide visual information about the state of your project. Clone - This icon allows you to copy the project. Locked - Shows that project has not been made public. Only the team can view it. Hovering your mouse over a project element will make administration icons appear. Rename - Change the name of the element. Export - Export this element. It can then be added to other projects. Clone - Projects can have more than one workflow. Delete - Removes the selected element. A project has three main screens to navigate. Project - where the main elements of the research are accessed. Discussions - Where team members and public users can discuss and comment. Activities - A log of the comments and operations performed on the project. Selecting the Activities tab shows a history of the project. Comments and changes are recorded here in a decending timeline. Clicking on a link will bring you to the relevant event. Selecting the Discussions tab shows a forum where feedback in information is shared. Discussion threads can be created and comments added by anyone with permission to view the project. The Admin of the project can edit and delete all comments. The Project tab contains the main elements of the research project organised in Functions Bar- The main commands which can be performed on a project. Latest Activity - The latest action on the project recorded in Activities. Elements - the files that are attached to the project. They can be documents, data or workflows. Upload data Click New data set to add a data file Give your data a name. Browse to the location of the data file and select it Tercen will attempt to detect the type of data file you have added. You can over-ride the settings by selecting the following Seperator character Style used for quotes Encoding Type Latin 1 is the simplest encoding type but does not recognise all possible diacritical marks. If you have data in a language with many accent marks encode your data as UTF-8 before uploading. Tercen will attempt to recognise your data and will show you error messages to help debug it. When your data is recognised Tercen will display a representation of it. Click the `Next button (I don’t know what this is) Click Ok to complete the upload of your data Import and view workflows Workflows can be imported as a .zip file created by exporting from another project. Workflows can be created new. Worflows can be viewed and edited by clicking on its element link. When creating or viewing a workflow you will see the Workflow page For more information on creating and modifying workflows see the next chapter.
