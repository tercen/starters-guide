["index.html", "Starter’s guide to Tercen Chapter 1 Introduction", " Starter’s guide to Tercen Tercen support document Chapter 1 Introduction This step-by-step guide outlines how to upload, view, compute and share data using tercen. It uses a multivariate example data set of morphological measurements of two species of Leptograpsus Crabs collected at Fremantle, W. Australia (see Mahon 1974). Why read this guide? : It is the easiest and quickest path to understanding the basics of tercen. Acknowledgement: I would like to thank all the users for their feedback. It has helped us improve tercen. Feedback: If you wish to give feedback then please do not hesitate to create an entry in the issue tracker. Motivation: Tercen promotes collaboration for data analysis. Not everyone can code or even wants to, but everyone should benefit from the explosion of data and code currently taking place. tercen allows non programmers (e.g. biologists) to explore their data and allows programmers (e.g. bioinformaticians) to upload their code (or web-apps) for the biologist to use. By offering these services we believe biologists get empowered and can claim back control of their data. The bioinformatician gets liberated from the operational details and day to day analysis demands from the biologist. This is summed up with the phrase: Tercen empowers the biologist and liberates the bioinformatician. "],

It will look like the image below: The “crabs_longformat” is preloaded data, containing information about crabs. We performed a PCA on the data using one of our Operators. We call this a data step. Doubleclick on PCA You can see that we visualised the data from the crabs_longformat table using heatmap. The __ PCA operator__ is shown on the left. The data produced by this data step can be visualized by adding another data step. Go back to the workflow main page by clicking on Tutorial workflow Click on PCA results On the left side of the projection you can see the results of the PCA are available for visualization. We visualized the data using PC1 and PC2, while coloring the species and sex of the crabs. Thanks to the drag and drop way of working in Tercen you can quickly and intuitively visualize the results of your data. Your data can be visualized in many ways using Tercen and every visualization can provide different insights. Next we will visualize the crabs_longformat using a pair-wise plot. Click on Tutorial workflow to go back to the workflow page Click on Pair-wise plot You will see the projection of the data step, as seen in the image below. In this projection you can see that we visualized the differences between male and female, by coloring by sex. In the columns you can appreciate that you can add multiple levels, differentiating between the species and the variables. You now have an idea of the possibilities using Tercen.
