["index.html", "The Starters Guide to Tercen Chapter 1 Introduction", " The Starters Guide to Tercen Chapter 1 Introduction There has been an explosion of data in Business and Life Sciences. Not everyone can code, or even wants to, but everyone wants to benefit from the wealth of information generated by this revolution. Tercen is the cloud based analytics platform that makes this happen. We provide simple visual tools that allow a non-programmer to build powerful data-analysis models and sophisticated visualisations. Biologists can explore their data sets unaided. You can drag and drop complex computations together. No need to wait for a Bioinformatician. This benefits the bioinformatician too. Computations are standardised with apps and workflows. Day-to-day admin is off-loaded while you focus on more interesting projects. Tercen promotes open science. It’s a platform for scientists to collaborate. Share your findings, get feedback. Your project could be cloned to benefit areas far beyond your original scope. This is how Tercen helps you to take back control of your data. It empowers you to drive forward with your research. Biologists are empowered. Bioinformaticians… liberated. Next… about this guide. "],

["define-a-team.html", "Chapter 6 Define a team", " Chapter 6 Define a team Teams are an important concept in Tercen. Researchers are members of a team and as part of the team they create and own projects. Teams have the following characteristics. A team is created by a user. The creator is the Administrator of the team. Teams are composed of members. Users can be members of many teams. Teams own a Library of Apps and a set Projects they are applied to Members have access permissions to control how they affect the things the team owns. In Tercen you always work in a team. Even if it is just a single member of your personal team. To create a team select the Teams tab on your personal home page. Press the New Team button. Configure the team on the administration page. Name the team Enter the user-name of any person you want to add to the team. Select their access permissions. Read - Can view and clone projects Read Write - Can modify projects, such as adding operators to work-flows Admin - Can add and remove users to the team and change their permissions Click the Ok button to save your configuration. Modifying Teams A Teams membership can be modified at later stage. To do this, access the Team page by clicking its icon.

["add-apps-to-a-library.html", "Chapter 7 Add apps to a library", " Chapter 7 Add apps to a library Each personal user, and each team, has a repository of apps called a Library. Apps are the workhorses of a Project and perform the calculations on the data you upload. There are different types of App. template app defines an analysis pipeline to suit a type of research (e.g. RNAseq). workflow app a pre-defined set of computations and their visualisations (e.g. a two-group comparison) operator app performs a single computation on the data. (e.g. PCA function) Libraries can be built from differant sources such as the public Tercen app library or uploaded from private sources such as GitHub. For a more in-depth discussion of apps, and their uses, please see the User Guide. Installing Apps To install an app to your Library select your personal home page Or move to a Team Page by clicking the icon Press the Add operator button Select the app you want to add. It will turn green. (You can click on the More link to read detailed information on this app.) Click the Ok button to save your selection. Next… understanding how projects work. "],
["understanding-projects.html", "Chapter 8 Understanding projects Explore public projects Clone an existing project Create a new project", " Chapter 8 Understanding projects Projects are another key concept in Tercen, they are the containers where your research is held. Projects can be set as private or public. Private projects can only be viewed by the person or team that owns it. They can be copied and adjusted only by these people. Public projects can be viewed and collaborated-on by the wider community. They can be copied by anyone and used as a basis for new research. Projects have the following characteristics. A project is created by a Team. Data is uploaded to projects. Workflows are attached to projects - to analyse and create visualisations of data. Projects hold the record of comments and feedback submitted by your team or community. Supporting documents can be uploaded to projects. Explore public projects To access the Tercen public projects click the Explore link in the header bar. You will be taken to the public projects page. It is divided into two sections. Collections is where Tercen displays sponsored research examples Community is where all of the projects made Public by their creators appear. Clone an existing project Tercen provides two ways to create a project. Create New - A blank project which you will add data and workflows to. Clone - A copy of an existing project, which you then modify. The simplest method for creating a project is to Clone from a pre-existing project. Any project can be cloned once you have access to it. Personal projects, projects created by your teams, and public shared projects can all be cloned. Find the project you wish to clone. For example, in the public community. Hover your mouse over the project until the Clone icon appears. Click the Clone icon. Select the destination of the new project, your personal home page or, one of your teams. Click the Next Button Edit the name and description of your new project. Decide if you want to make it publicly available. Click the Ok Button Cloning copies the data, workflows, and supporting documents contained in the original project. Discussion forum posts and activity histories are not copied. These are re-set to be blank. Your new project is now ready for modification. Create a new project From your personal home page Click the New Project Button Assign the project to an owner. You personally, or a team. Click the Next button. Add a name and description of your project and choose to make it public or keep it private. Click the Ok button. From a Team page Click the New Project Button Projects created this way are automatically assigned to the team. Add a name and description of your project and choose to make it public or keep it private. Click Ok You have created a new project Next… working with projects. "],
["working-with-projects.html", "Chapter 9 Working with projects Navigating and commenting Upload data Import and view workflows Adding Documentation", " Chapter 9 Working with projects This section will orientate you to the Tercen project screens. You will learn the meanings of the icons. You will be shown how to upload data and view a workflow. Navigating and commenting Icons perform administrative tasks and to provide visual information about the status of your project. Clone - This icon allows you to copy the project. Locked - Shows that project has not been made public. Only the team can view it. Hovering your mouse over a project element will cause administration icons to appear. Rename - Change the name of the element. Export - Export this element. It can then be added to other projects. Clone - Projects can have more than one workflow. Delete - Removes the selected element. A project has three main tabs for organisation. Project - where the main elements of the research are accessed. Discussions - Where team members and public users can discuss and comment. Activities - A log of the comments and operations performed on the project. Selecting the Activities tab will show a history of the project. Any comments or changes are logged here. They are listed in a descending time-line. Clicking on a link will bring you to the relevant event. Selecting the Discussions tab will show the forums where feedback is shared. Discussion threads can be created and comments added by anyone with permission to view the project. Users with project admin permissions can edit or delete all comments. The Project tab contains three sections containing elements of the research project. Functions Bar The main commands which can be performed on a project. Latest Activity The last action on the project as logged in Activities. Elements List These are the files that are attached to the project. They can be documents, data, or workflows. Upload data Click New data set to add a data file Give your data a name. Browse to the location of the data file and select it Tercen will attempt to detect the type of data file you have added. You can over-ride the settings by selecting the following Seperator character Style used for quotes Encoding Type Latin 1 is the simplest encoding type but does not recognise all possible diacritical marks. If you have data in a language with many accent marks encode your data as UTF-8 before uploading. Tercen will attempt to recognise your data and will show you error messages to help debug it. When your data is recognised Tercen will display a representation of it. Click the `Next button There is an optional screen where data in a wide format can be configured to have a long format. This is useful for some later calculations. Click Ok to complete the upload of your data Import and view workflows Workflows can be imported from a .zip file that was exported from another project. New Workflows can be created from the function bar. A pre-existing Workflow can be viewed, and edited, by clicking on its link. Creating or viewing a workflow will bring you to the Workflow builder page For more detailed information on creating and modifying workflows see the next chapter. Adding Documentation Documents can be added to a project through the function bar. The New File button opens a text editor to write a file directly into Tercen File created in different programs are attached using the Import File button. Next… Navigating through Workflows. "],
["understanding-workflows.html", "Chapter 10 Understanding workflows", " Chapter 10 Understanding workflows Workflows contain the core functionality of Tercen. They are the place where computations are performed and visualisations are created from the results. In this Chapter you will learn how to navigate the workflow building page, identify Data Steps, and view visualisations. It is not intended for you to be an expert immediately after reading this guide. Further study is recommended before you attempt to create your own workflow. A great next step is to complete our tutorial which shows you how to re-create our example Crabs Project. The Workflow Building Page The best way to start getting familiar with workflows is to clone an existing project and examine it. Browse to Explore and select the tercen/Crabs Tutorial press the Clone icon. In the elements section click the workflow named Crabs to view the workflow builder page. It will look like this. Data Steps and Links Workflows are made up of Data Steps (represented by boxes) and links (represented by lines) They are arranged in a hierarchy where the output of a Data Step forms the input of the Step linked in the tier below. Both the calculations made by operators in the Data Step, and the original data, are passed to the next step. The first step in a workflow is always the Data Table which was created when data was uploaded (see Chapter 9) Manipulating Data Steps Data Steps are added and adjusted by means of two menus activated by right clicking your mouse. Right clicking on the white background of the builder brings up the short menu. Save workflow - Important after a modification to a step or after performing a caluclation Add - Add a new step which you will link manually Run All - Execute all calculations performed by operators in all steps. Right clicking on a Data Step brings up the long menu. Run/Reset - Activate or clear the internal calculations performed by this step. Edit - Open the visualisation page to view and perform calculations Rename - Change the Data step label Remove - Delete the Data Step Duplicate - Copy a Step. The new one is linked in the same tier. Add - Add a new step which is linked in the tier below. Linking Steps added from the long menu are linked automatically. Steps can be linked manually by clicking on nodes. Running The Data Step will show a green light when it has performed it’s internal calculations and the results are ready to pass to the next tier. Steps which have been adjusted, reset, or newly added need to be re-calculated. Viewing a Data Visualisation Double click on a data step or edit it from the long menu to view the projection made by that step. You will see the Projection Page. It is divided into sections. The link bar shows the data being used by this step. This included the original table and any re-factored data from previous steps. The Factors section shows the groups and variables that are being used. They can be the headers from your original data file or groups made by the calculations of a previous data step. The filters and visualisations control panel control how your output looks. The operators panel allows you to add or change which operator from your library is being applied. You can run and re-set calculations here. Thank you for reading the Tercen starters guide we hope you have gained enough knowledge to navigate the software and begin to learn how it is used.
