["index.html", "Starter’s guide to Tercen Chapter 1 Introduction", " Starter’s guide to Tercen Tercen support document Chapter 1 Introduction This step-by-step guide outlines how to upload, view, compute and share data using Tercen. It uses a multivariate example data set of morphological measurements of two species of Leptograpsus Crabs collected at Fremantle, W. Australia (see Mahon 1974). Why read this guide? : It is the easiest and quickest path to understanding the basics of Tercen. Acknowledgement: I would like to thank all the users for their feedback. It has helped us improve Tercen. Feedback: If you wish to give feedback then please do not hesitate to create an entry in the issue tracker. Motivation: Tercen promotes collaboration for data analysis. Not everyone can code or even wants to, but everyone should benefit from the explosion of data and code currently taking place. Tercen allows non programmers (e.g. biologists) to explore their data and allows programmers (e.g. bioinformaticians) to upload their code (or web-apps) for the biologist to use. By offering these services we believe biologists get empowered and can claim back control of their data. The bioinformatician gets liberated from the operational details and day to day analysis demands from the biologist. This is summed up with the phrase: Tercen empowers the biologist and liberates the bioinformatician. "],

You start off in your personal page. Click on Teams Click on Crabs team Click on Crabs project You are now on the crabs project page and it looks like: it contains the folllowing: Project tab Data Workflow Discussion tab Activity tab Click on Crabs workflow The workflow is opened and can interact on your data. It will look like the image below: The “crabs_longformat” is preloaded data, containing information about crabs. We performed a PCA on the data using one of our Operators. We call this a data step. Doubleclick on PCA You see that we visualised the data from the crabs_longformat table using a heatmap. The __ PCA operator__ is shown on the left. The data produced by this data step is visualized by adding another data step. Go back to the workflow main page by clicking on Crabs workflow Click on PCA results On the left side of the projection you see the results of the PCA. We visualized the data using PC1 and PC2, while coloring the species and sex of the crabs. Thanks to the drag and drop way of working in Tercen you can quickly and intuitively visualize the results of your data. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD Your data can be visualized in many ways using Tercen and every visualization can provide different insights. Next we will visualize the crabs_longformat using a pair-wise plot. ======= Your data can be visualized in many ways using tercen and every visualization can provide different insights. Next you will visualize the crabs_longformat using a pair-wise plot. Click on Crabs workflow to go back to the workflow page 51f05425df5e488a0435ce0890df3d652a6b95ff Click on Pair-wise plot You will see the projection of the data step, as seen in the image below. In this projection you see that we visualized the differences between male and female, by coloring by sex. In the columns you can appreciate that you can add multiple levels, differentiating between the species and the variables. You now have an idea of the possibilities using Tercen. For more information about how to upload and work with your own data, continue reading the getting started guide. "],

["glossary.html", "Chapter 9 Glossary", " Chapter 9 Glossary Measurement: A numerical variable, i.e. count in RNA-seq or Signal value in flow cytometry, pixel value in imaging. Observation: An observation is the factor name given to a value (measurement), at a particular period, of a particular variable. Variable: A variable is a characteristic of a unit being observed that may assume more than one of a set of values to which a numerical measure or a category from a classification can be assigned (e.g. income, age, weight, etc., and “occupation”, “industry”, “disease”, etc.) Table: A table is the fundamental data structure for Tercen. A project and workflow is composed of many tables. Cross-tab window: The view in Tercen used to perform a projections Projection: A data projection is used to query the data. It is performed in the Cross-tab window. The projection results a selection of y-axis, row, col, x-axis, color, label. Long format: A data structure where there is only one measurement of interest per row. Wide format: A data structure where there are many measurements per row. "]
