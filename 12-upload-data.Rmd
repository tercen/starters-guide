# Upload the data
In this section we upload the crabs dataset to your teams project.

__Tercen__ accepts data in either _.tsv_ or _csv_. The example data set ``crabs_longformat.csv`` is in a _.csv_ format and is in a _long format_. On the bottom of this section we will show the differences between a _long format_ and a _wide format. Also we provide you with the example dataset's download location, which you will use for this guide.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Example dataset:\
The data set for this guide is available online as a git hub repository. 

* Go to the file, by clicking on the following git hub address:

(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tercen/starters-guide2/master/data/crabs_longformat.csv)

* Once it opens, right click and select `Save as...`

Save your data on your desktop. Use the default name (it should be `crabs_longformat.csv`).


__Crab data description:__

The data set is called "Crabs" and it is in a _long format_. It has a total of 1000 measurements of crab physical traits. It is composed of four groups (two sexes and two species) of 50 measurements for five traits variables, `FL` (frontal lobe size in mm), `RW` (rear width mm), `CL` (carapace length mm), `CW` (carapace width mm) and `BD` (body depth mm). In summary it is:  

Factor|values
------|---
`sp` |species, `B` or `O` for <span style="color:blue">Blue</span> or <span style="color:orange">Orange</span>.
`sex`|`M` or `F`
`index`|index 1 to 50 within each of the four groups, 2 sex and 2 species
`variable`|one of five variables: `FL`, `RW`, `CL`, `CW` and `BD`
`measurement`| the value of one of the five `variable`
`observation`| index 1 to 200 observations for each variable

The difference between a _wide format_ and a _long format_:\
In a _long format_ only __one__ measurement is described in a single row, which makes the table very long, hence the name.
<center><img src="images/Data_long.png"></center>\
In a _wide format_ __multiple__ measurements are described in a single row, for example genome data often contains the different samples in the columns.
